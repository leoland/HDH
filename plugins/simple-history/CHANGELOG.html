<p>= 2.5 (December 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Category edits are now logged, so now you can see terms, categories and taxonomies that are added, changed, and deleted. Fixes for example https://wordpress.org/support/topic/view-changes-to-categories and https://twitter.com/hmarafi/status/655994402037362688.</li>
<li>Fixed: The media logger now shows the width and height of uploaded images again.</li>
<li>Fixed: IP Lookup using ipinfo.io would fail if your site was using HTTPS (pro account on ipinfo.io required for that), so now falls back to opening a link to ipinfo.io in a new tab instead.</li>
<li>Fixed: If there was a server error while loading the log, the error would be shown, to help you debug any errors. The error would however not go away if you successfully loaded the log again. Now it does.</li>
<li>Changed: The search/filter now falls back to showing events for the last 14 days, if 30 days would return over 1000 pages of events. This change is to try to make the log fail to load in less scenarios. If a site got a bit spike if brute force attacks (yes, it&#8217;s always those attacks!) then there could be a big jump in the number of events and pages between 14 days and 30 days.</li>
<li>Changed: Failed login attempts now use shorter messages and shorter variable names. Not really the fault of this plugin, but sites can get a huge amount of failed login attempts logged. Sites with almost 2 million logged rows just in the last 60 days for example. And that will cause the database tables with the history to grow to several hundreds of megabyte. So to make those tables a bit smaller the plugin now uses shorter messages for failed login attempts, shorter variable names, and it stores less data. If you want to stop hackers from attacking your site (resulting in big history logs) you should install a plugin like <a href="https://jetpack.me/support/security-features/">Jetpack and its BruteProtect module</a>.</li>
<li>Updated: Added date filter to show just events from just one day. Useful for sites that get hammered by brute force login attempts. On one site where I had 166434 login attempts the last 7 days this helped to make the log actually load :/.</li>
<li>Updated: New French translation</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.4 (November 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Now logs when a user changes their password using the &#8220;reset password&#8221; link.</li>
<li>Added: Now logs when a user uses the password reset form.</li>
<li>Added: New method <code>register_dropin</code> that can be used to add dropins.</li>
<li>Added: New action <code>simple_history/add_custom_dropin</code>.</li>
<li>Added: Example on how to add an external dropin: <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-dropin.php">example-dropin.php</a>.</li>
<li>Added: &#8220;Last day&#8221; added to filter, because a brute force attack can add so many logs that it&#8217;s not possible to fetch a whole week.</li>
<li>Changed: Filter <code>simple_history/log/do_log</code> now pass 5 arguments instead of 3. Before this update in was not possible for multiple add_action()-calls to use this filter, because you would not now if any other code had canceled it and so on. If you have been using this filter you need to modify your code.</li>
<li>Changed: When hovering the time of an event in the log, the date of the event displays in both local time and GMT time. Hopefully makes it easier for admins in different timezones that work together on a site to understand when each event happened. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/84.</li>
<li>Fixed: Line height was a bit tight on the dashboard. Also: the margin was a tad to small for the first logged event on the dashboard.</li>
<li>Fixed: Username was not added correctly to failed login attempts when using plugin Captcha on Login + it would still show that a user logged out sometimes when a bot/script brute force attacked a site by only sending login and password and not the captcha field.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.3.1 (October 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Hopefully fixed the wrong relative time, as reported here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wrong-reporting-time.</li>
<li>Changed: The RSS-feed with updates is now disabled by default for new installs. It is password protected, but some users felt that is should be optional to activate it. And now it is! Thanks to https://github.com/guillaumemolter for adding this feature.</li>
<li>Fixed: Failed login entries when using plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha-on-login/">Captcha on Login</a> was reported as &#8220;Logged out&#8221; when they really meant &#8220;Failed to log in&#8221;. Please note that this was nothing that Simple History did wrong, it was rather Captcha on Login that manually called <code>wp_logout()</code> each time a user failed to login. Should fix all those mystery &#8220;Logged out&#8221;-entried some of you users had.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/log/do_log</code> that can be used to shortcut the log()-method.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.3 (October 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: The title of the browser tab with Simple History open will now show the number of new and unread events available. Nice feature to have if you keep a tab with the Simple History log open but in the background: now you can see directly in the title if new events are available. Such small change. Very much nice.</li>
<li>Added: If the AJAX call to fetch the log failed, a message now appears telling the user that something went wrong. Also, the output from the server is displayed so they can get a hint of what&#8217;s going wrong. Hopefully this will reduce the number of support requests that is caused by other plugins.</li>
<li>Fixed: Edited posts/pages/custom post types does not get a linked title unless the user viewing the log has edit rights.</li>
<li>Fixed: Another try to fix the notice error here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.</li>
<li>Updated: Danish translation updated.</li>
<li>Updated: POT file updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.2.4 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Basic support for plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/">Ultimate Member</a>, so users logging in using the plugin will now be logged in Simple History. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-with-ultimate-member.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/logger/interpolate/context</code> that can be used to modify the variables sent to the message template.</li>
<li>Changed: Remove &#8220;type&#8221; key from context detail table, because it&#8217;s an old an unused column.</li>
<li>Changed: During a first install the plugin now creates a few less columns than before (some columns where left from version 1 of the plugin).</li>
<li>Changed: Don&#8217;t show the &#8220;translate this plugin&#8221; metabox for any english talking locale.</li>
<li>Changed: Don&#8217;t show the GitHub metabox.</li>
<li>Fixed: If the plugin is deleted (but why?!) then the context table is also removed now.</li>
<li>Behind the scenes: More unit tests! Hopefully more nasty things will get caught before releasing new versions of the plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.2.3 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: On new installs the database tables was not created correctly and new events could not be logged.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.2.2 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Logging stopped working for languages other then English. Sorry about that!</li>
<li>Fixed: When running unit tests for a site where Simple History is a must use plugin it sometimes tried to create tables and add columns more then once. Now uses <code>if not exists</code> and similar to only try to create the tables if they not already exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.2.1 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Missed to log users switching back on using the User Switching plugin. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/89.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.2 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Support for plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/">User Switching</a>. The event log will show when a user switched to another user, when they switched back, or when they switched off.</li>
<li>Added: Support for plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/">Enable Media Replace</a>. Whenever a user replaces an attachment with a new, you will now know about it and also see the name of both the old and the new attachment. Awesome!</li>
<li>Fixed: Mouse over (:hover state) on buttons no longer use blue background. Now works much better with admin themes other than the standard one. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pagination-button-design.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.7 (September 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Date and time in the log was using GMT time rather than local time. Could be confusing. Even very confusing if living in a time zone far far away from the GMT zone.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.6 (August 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated: Danish translation updated. Thanks translator!</li>
<li>Fixed: Icon on settings page was a bit unaligned on WordPress not running the latest beta version (hrm, which I guess most of you were..)</li>
<li>Fixed: Possible php notice. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.</li>
<li>Changed: Logged messages are now trimmed by default (spaces and new lines will be removed from messages).</li>
<li>Updated: When installing and activating the plugin it will now add the same &#8220;plugin installed&#8221; and &#8220;plugin activated&#8221; message that other plugins get when they are installed. These events where not logged before because the plugin was not installed and could therefor not log its own installation. Solution was to log it manually. Works. Looks good. But perhaps a bit of cheating.</li>
<li>Added: A (hopefully) better welcome message when activating the plugin for the first time. Hopefully the new message makes new users understand a bit better why the log may be empty at first.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.5 (August 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: It was not possible to modify the filters <code>simple_history/view_settings_capability</code> and <code>simple_history/view_history_capability</code> from the <code>functions.php</code>-file in a theme (filters where applied too early - they did however work from within a plugin!)</li>
<li>Changed: Use <code>h1</code> instead of <code>h2</code> on admin screens. Reason for this the changes in 4.3: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress&#8211;4&#8211;3/.</li>
<li>Removed: the constant <code>VERSION</code> is now removed. Use constant <code>SIMPLE_HISTORY_VERSION</code> instead of you need to check the current version of Simple History.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.4 (July 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: WordPress core updates got the wrong previous version.</li>
<li>Updated: Updated German translations.</li>
<li>Added: GHU header added to plugin header, to support <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater">GitHub Updater plugin</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.3 (July 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Ajax error when loading a log that contained uploaded images.</li>
<li>Fixed: Removed some debug log messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.2 (July 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Changed: By default the log now shows events from the last week, last two weeks or last 30 days, all depending on how many events you have in your log. The previous behavior was to not apply any filtering what so ever during the first load. Anyway: this change makes it possible to load the log very quickly even for very large logs. A large amount of users + keeping the log forver = millions of rows of data. Previously this could stall the log or make it load almost forever. Now = almost always very fast. I have tried it with over 5.000 users and a million row and yes - zing! - much faster. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/load-with-pagination-mysql.</li>
<li>Added: Finnish translation. Thanks a lot to the translator!</li>
<li>Updated: Swedish translation updated</li>
<li>Added: Cache is used on a few more places.</li>
<li>Added: Plugin now works as a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins">&#8220;must-use-plugin&#8221;</a>. Props <a href="https://github.com/jacquesletesson">jacquesletesson</a>.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/show_more_filters_on_load</code> that is used to control if the search options should be expanded by default when the history page is loaded. Default is false, to have a less cluttered GUI.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_user_ids</code> that is used to search/filter specific user ids by default (no need to search and select users). Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-pass-array-of-user-ids-to-history-query.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_loglevel</code> that is used to search/filter for log levels by default.</li>
<li>Fixed: if trying to log an array or an object the logger now automagically runs <code>json_encode()</code> on the value to make it a string. Previously is just tried to run `$wpdb-&gt;insert() with the array and that gave errors. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/mysql_real_escape_string.</li>
<li>Fixed: The function that checks for new rows each second (or actually each tenth second to spare resources) was called an extra time each time the submit button for the filter was clicked. Kinda stupid. Kinda fixed now.</li>
<li>Fixed: The export feature that was added in version 2.1 was actually not enabled for all users. Now it is!</li>
<li>Fixed: Image attachments that is deleted from file system no longer result in &#8220;broken image&#8221; in the log. (Rare case, I know, but it does happen for me that local dev server and remote prod server gets out of &#8220;sync&#8221; when it comes to attachments.)</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1.1 (May 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed: filter <code>simple_history/dropins_dir</code> removed.</li>
<li>Changed: Dropins are not loaded from a <code>glob()</code> call anymore (just like plugins in the prev release)</li>
<li>Updated: Brazilian Portuguese translation updated.</li>
<li>Fixed: POT file updated for translators.</li>
<li>Fixed: Better sanitization of API arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.1 (May 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Export! Now it&#8217;s possible to export the events log to a JSON or CSV formatted file. It&#8217;s your data so you should be able to export it any time you want or need. And now you can do that. You will find the export function in the Simple History settings page (Settings -&gt; Simple History).</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/add_custom_logger</code> and function <code>register_logger</code> that together are used to load external custom loggers. See <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-logger.php">example-logger.php</a> for usage example.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/header_initiator_use_you</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed: Fixed an undefined variable in get_avatar(). Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/74.</li>
<li>Fixed: When using <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hyperdb">HyperDB</a> only one event was returned. Fixed by using <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hyperdb/trunk/db.php?#L49">adding <code>NO_SELECT_FOUND_ROWS</code> to the query</a>. Should fix problems for users using HyperDB and also users using for example <a href="http://wpengine.com">wpengine.com</a> (that probably also is using HyperDB or a similar approach).</li>
<li>Changed: Loggers now get default capability &#8220;manage_options&#8221; if they have no capability set.</li>
<li>Changed: Misc internal cleanup.</li>
<li>Removed: filter <code>simple_history/loggers_dir</code> removed, because loggers are loaded from array instead of file listing generated from <code>glob()</code>. Should be (however to the eye non-noticable) faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.30 (May 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Username of logged events now link to that user&#8217;s profile.</li>
<li>Fixed: When expanding ocassions the first loaded occasion was the same event as the one you expanded from, and the last ocassion was missing. Looked extra stupid when only 1 occasion existed, and you clicked &#8220;show ocassions&#8221; only to just find the same event again. So stupid. But fixed now!</li>
<li>Fixed: If an event had many similar events the list of similar events could freeze the browser. (<a href="https://twitter.com/eskapism/status/595478847598002176">17948 failed login attempts overnight</a> is not that uncommon it turns out!)</li>
<li>Fixed: Some loggers were missing the &#8220;All&#8221;-message in the search.</li>
<li>Changed: Hide some more keys and values by default in the context data popup.</li>
<li>Changed: Use <code>truncate</code> instead of <code>delete</code> when clearing the database. Works much faster on large logs.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.29 (April 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Introducing <a href="http://eskapism.se/blog/2015/04/quick-diff-shows-post-changes-in-wordpress/">Post &#8220;Quick Diff&#8221;</a> – a very simple and efficient way to quickly see what’s been changed in a post. With Quick Diff you will in a glance see the difference between the title, permalink, content, publish date, post status, post author, or the template of the post. It&#8217;s really a super simple and fast way to follow the work of your co-editors.</li>
<li>Added: Filter to add custom HTML above and after the context data table. They are named <code>simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_before_context_table</code> and <code>simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_after_context_table</code> (and yes, I do fancy really long filter names).</li>
<li>Added: Filters to control what to output in the data/context details table (the popup you see when you click the time of each event): <code>simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/row_keys_to_show</code> and <code>simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/context_keys_to_show</code>. Also added <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php">two usage examples</a> for the filters.</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/log_insert_context</code> to control what gets saved to the context table. Example on usage for this is also available in the <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php">example file</a>.</li>
<li>Added: data attribute <code>data-ip-address-multiple</code> and class <code>SimpleHistoryLogitem--IPAddress-multiple</code> added for events that have more than one IP address detected. Happens when <code>http_x_forwarded_for</code> or similar headers are included in response.</li>
<li>Updated: Danish translation updated.</li>
<li>Fixed: Images in GitHub readme files are now displayed correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed: Readme files to GitHub repositories ending with slash (/) now works correctly too.</li>
<li>Fixed: IP Info popup is now again closeable with <code>ESC</code> key or with a click outside it.</li>
<li>Fixed: Some enqueued scripts had double slashes in them.</li>
<li>Fixed: Make sure <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/">URLs from add_query_arg() gets escaped</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed: Some other small things.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.28 (April 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Do not try to load the Translation Install API if using WordPress before 4.0. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/67.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.27 (April 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Even better support for plugins from GitHub with the <code>GitHub Plugin URI</code> header. Plugin install, deactivations, and activations should have correct view-info-links now.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
<li>Updated: Swedish translation updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.26 (March 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Plugin installs from wordpress.org would show &#8220;wordpress plugin directory&#8221; as their source file. Looked stupid. Fixed now!</li>
<li>Added: <code>composer.json</code> added, so Simple History can be pulled in to other projects via <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. Actually untested, but at least the file is there. Please let me know if it works! :)</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.25 (March 2015) =</p>

<li>Fixed: Messages for disabled loggers was not shown.</li>
<li>Fixed: An error when trying to show edit link for deleted comments.</li>
<li>Fixed: Use a safer way to get editable roles. Hopefully fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-warnings-simpleloggerphp-on-line&#8211;162.</li>
<li>Fixed: Some notice warnings from the comments logger.</li>
<li>Changed: Some other small things too.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.24 (March 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Plugin installs from uploaded ZIP files are now logged correctly. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/59.</li>
<li>Fixed: Check that JavaScript variables it set and that the object have properties set. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/firefox&#8211;37-js-error-generated-by-simplehistoryipinfodropinjs.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
<li>Changed: Loading of loggers, dropins, and so one are moved from action <code>plugins_loaded</code> to <code>after_setup_theme</code> so themes can actually use for example the load_dropin_*-filters&#8230;</li>

</ul>

<p>= 2.0.23 (March 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/rss_item_link</code>, so plugins can modify the link used in the RSS feed.</li>

<li>Fixed: A missing argument error when deleting a plugin. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/warning-missing-argument&#8211;1-for-simplepluginlogger.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.22 (February 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Deleted plugins were not logged correctly (name and other info was missing).</li>
<li>Added: Filter <code>simple_history/logger/load_logger</code> and <code>simple_history/dropin/load_dropin</code> that can be used to control the loading of each logger or dropin. See <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php">example file</a> for usage examples.</li>
<li>Fixed: modal window with context data now works better on small screens.</li>
<li>Changed: Misc internal changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.21 (February 2015) =</p>

<li>Changed: RSS feed now has loglevel of event prepended to the title.</li>
<li>Changed: Options logger now only shows the first 250 chars of new and old option values. Really long values could make the log look strange.</li>
<li>Added: If constant <code>SIMPLE_HISTORY_LOG_DEBUG</code> is defined and true automatically adds <code>$_GET</code>, <code>$_POST</code>, and more info to each logged event. Mostly useful for the developer, but maybe some of you are a bit paranoid and want it too.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.20 (February 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: changes via <a href="http://wp-cli.org">WP-CLI</a> is now detected (was previously shown as &#8220;other&#8221;).</li>
<li>Added: severity level (info, warning, debug, etc.) of event is includes in the RSS output.</li>
<li>Changed the way user login is logged. Should fix https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/40 + possible more related issues.</li>
<li>Added: filter <code>simple_history/simple_logger/log_message_key</code> added, that can be used to shortcut log messages. See <a href="https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php">example file</a> for usage. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stop-logging-certain-types-of-activity.</li>
<li>Added: now uses object caching at some places. Should speed up some parts of the plugin for users with caching enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed: IP info popup can now be closed with <code>esc</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed: works better on small screens (like mobile phones) + misc other style related fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.19 (February 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: Dutch translation by <a href="https://github.com/niknetniko">https://github.com/niknetniko</a>. Thanks!</li>
<li>Changed: better compatibilty with plugins like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/">WP User Avatar</a>.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation update.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.18 (January 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: really correctly show the version number of the previous version!</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.17 (January 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Added: messages added using for example <code>SimpleLogger()-&gt;info( __(&quot;My log message&quot;) )</code> that have translations now auto translated the message back to english before storing the message (together with the text domain). Then upon retrieval it uses the english message + the text domain to translate the message to the currently selected language. This makes it easier to make multilingual log entries. (Yeah, I know its hard to understand what the heck this does, but it&#8217;s something good and cool, trust me!)</li>
<li>Added: A sidebar with text contents on the history page.</li>
<li>Changed: Search now shows only the search box by default, with a link to show all search options.</li>
<li>Fixed: Search is now available at the dashboard again. Hooray!</li>
<li>Fixed: Old entries were not cleared automatically. Now it correctly removes old events, so your database will not risk growing to large.</li>
<li>Fixed: Quick stats could show two messages sometimes.</li>
<li>Fixed: When headers like <code>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR</code> exists all valid IPs in that header is now stored.</li>
<li>Fixed: Plugin updates via third party software like <a href="http://infinitewp.com/">InfiniteWP</a> should now correctly show the version number of the previous version.</li>
<li>Updated: German translation updated.</li>
<li>Notice: Do you read these messages? Then you must love this plugin! Come on then, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/simple-history">go and give it a nice review</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>= 2.0.16 (January 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For">X-Forwarded-For header</a>, if it is set, to determine remote IP address. Should now correctly store IP addresses for servers behind load balancers or for clients going through proxies. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-x-forwarded-for-http-header-when-logging-remote_addr.</li>
<li>Changed: Failed login attempts from unknown and known users are now grouped together. This change was made because a hacker could make many login attempts to a site and rotate the logins, so they would try with both existing and non existing user names, which would make the log flood with failed login attempts.</li>
<li>Changed: use &#8220;n similar events&#8221; instead of &#8220;n more&#8221;, to more cleary mark that the grouped events are not necessary exactly the same kind.</li>
<li>Changed: Quick stats text changed, to also include other sources. Previous behavior was to only include events from WordPress users, but now also events from anonymous users and WordPress (like from WP-Cron) are included.</li>

</ul>

<p>= 2.0.13 (January 2015) =</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed: RSS feed is now valid according to http://validator.w3.org/. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-feed-which-was-valid-under-v206-is-no-longer-under-v209-latest.</li>

This will get you the location and network of an IP address and help you determine from where for example a failed login attempt originates from. <a href="http://glui.me/?d=y89nbgmvmfnxl4r/ip%20address%20information%20popup.png/">See screenshot of IP address info in action</a>.</li>
<li>Added: new action <code>simple_history/admin_footer</code>, to output HTML and JavaScript in footer on pages that belong to Simple History</li>
<li>Added: new trigger for JavaScript: <code>SimpleHistory:logReloadStart</code>. Fired when the log starts to reload, like when using the pagination or using the filter function.</li>

<li><p>Added: filter to shortcut loading of a dropin. Example that completely skips loading the RSS-feed-dropin:

- mouse over on date now display detailed date a bit faster
- layout fixes to make it cooler, better, faster, stronger
- multiple events of same type, performed on the same object, by the same user, are now grouped together. This way 30 edits on the same page does not end up with 30 rows in Simple History. Much better overview!
- the name of deleted items now show up, instead of &#8220;Unknown name&#8221; or similar
- added support for plugins (who activated/deactivated what plugin)
- support for third party history items. Use like this:
simple_history_add(&#8220;action=repaired&amp;object_type=starship&amp;object_name=USS Enterprise&#8221;);
this would result in somehting like this:
Starship &#8220;USS Enterprise&#8221; repaired
